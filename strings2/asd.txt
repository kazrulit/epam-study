As  the world's leading manufacturer of both planes and trains, we've built an extensive and diverse portfolio of winning mobility solutions. Everywhere people travel by land and in the air, a Bombardier product is ready to transport them. From category-defining business jets and commercial aircraft designed for the challenges of today, to sleek high speed trains and public transit that's smarter than ever.
But it's not just our products and services that make us a global leader. The most important success factor is our employees, all 74,000 of them. Together we're focused on making mobility more efficient, sustainable and inviting than ever before. We call it The Evolution of Mobility.
